# Blog backend for a test assessment

Backend API for storing blogposts, comments, deleting, posting and updating.

To run this app on your machine you need to clone it first:

    git clone https://github.com/yaripey/testing-blog-backend
    cd testing-blog-backend

Then you need to install dependencies:

    npm install

Then you can just run:

    npm start

You can now access the API at *http://localhost:3001*.

You can find some requests for the *VS Code REST Client* in the **/requests** folder to test the API.
